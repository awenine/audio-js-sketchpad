## So far
- playing samples from file
- callbacks from sound to DOM
- synthesising tones (sine wave)
- sequencing / scheduling audio using audio context
- overlaying sequences using different tempos
- create basic sequences/rhythms
- randomise sounds played

## Next
- set audio sequence using canvas/GUI
- trigger sounds outside of beat grid?
- encapsulate sequencers & create more complex compositions
- more forms of synthesis
- how do effects work?
- volume and panning
- recording of audio
- get microphone input
- microphone / sample recording?
- can midi be implemented / written / read? (or other audio protocols)
- pipe audio material from other sites (for example, freesound)?
- websockets / other collaborative tools
